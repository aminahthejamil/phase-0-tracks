  * Take notes on the important points
  * Make a diagram of the flow of operations
2. Watch a few YouTube videos
3. Find cheatsheets
4. Research what other developers found to be difficult aspects of jQuery and how to overcome them

## What Worked?

1. The video series was very insightful and informative. I was able to grasp what the instructor was saying and apply it to my project.

2. Some of the written overviews were loaded with things that I didn't know about, such as AJAX. What I did understand, it helped me to see how jQuery connects the two (i.e. DOM manipulation, event handling, etc.)
