# Web Servers

1. Key design philosophies of the linux OS:
  * Minimalistic
  * Modular
  * Simple
2. What is a VPS?
  * A VPS is a remote server that allows you to have an individual server hosted at a certain location, which in essence give you the ability to store and run web apps, websites, and other web-based programs.
  * Advantages of using a VPS include:
    * Having your own bandwidth that you don't have to share with others (like BlueHost or GoDaddy)
    * You are in charge of and can manage your data (double-edged sword)
3. Running programs as the root user on linux
  * Running programs as root can have detrimental effects if you were to run commands that drastically change files and access codes. For example, when using a VPS, it is urged that you create a user profile outside of the root user profile in order to add, edit, or delete data. Root privileges are only to be used when updating things that have to do with security, access keys, etc.
