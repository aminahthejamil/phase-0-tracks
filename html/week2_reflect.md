# Week 2 Reflection

### Briefly describe your understanding of what the browser does, including definitions of the following:

* client
     * The client is essentially my computer or another person's computer
* server
     * The server is the remote "computer" that our client is reaching out to when we want to access some website or remote application
* render
     * The act of the server giving us the documents and files we asked for in the form of images and text, basically, in a form that we as humans can understand

### What is HTML? In your answer, include definitions of the following:

* tag
     * Used to create an html element, has a opening tag <here> and an ending tag </here>
* node
     * I don't recall going over this term, but after a search on MDN it is a DOM API object that allows various types of objects to be treated similarly.
* attribute
     * An attribute is a characteristic of the html element that can be found in the opening tag such as <p class="" style=""> or a opening tag that closes itself. The attribute is essentially a way to define an element to make it unique or identify it, amongst other things
* block element
     * Elements of an html document that apply to large blocks of space, such as a p, div, h1-6, fieldset, etc. They can be visualized as boxes that can be stacked on top of each other and are styled as a whole block.
* inline element
     * Elements that are found anywhere within a line of code. An example would be span, em, strong, etc. These can be found within a block level element at any location. However, they cannot contain block level elements.  

### Very briefly, explain the purpose of the following elements:

* head
     * The head is the part of an html document that houses various pieces of information about the document, such as the title, the language and character set in which the document is encoded, links to other documents that are needed for the html to run as it has been created to run, etc.
* body
     * The body is the part of an html document that houses the contents of the page, such as block level elements in the form of paragraphs, headers, and images. It also holds navigation information and is the part of the document that users actually interact with.
* p
     * A paragraph element, displays text
* form
     * Self-explanatory; it requests information from a user, such as name, email, address, answers to questions, etc. and sends this information to a database or allows the user to access a username/password-protected location
* div
     * A block level element container that holds various other elements and separates them via styling or location (e.g. by using css and bootstrap)
* span
     * An inline element that allows a section of a block level element to be styled differently than the rest of the block or output information differently than the rest of the block
* select
     * Used in form-making, is an element that displays options for a user to select
* h2
     * The second largest header
* ol
     * Creates an ordered list (e.g. 1-5)
* ul
     * Creates an unordered list (e.g. bullets)
* table
     * Table element that creates a table much like a spreadsheet
* tr
     * The tag used to create a row in a table
* td
     * Tag used to create a cell in a row in a table
