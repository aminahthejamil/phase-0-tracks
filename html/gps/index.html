    What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
    ** The purpose of semantic tags is to have a website that is better organized and
    makes more sense to the developer. It's also really helpful for accessibility

    Which ones do you see as most useful?
    ** Nav, main, sections, and articles, because they allow developers to separate
    the webpage into meaningful elements

    What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
    ** I'm not sure that I fully understand this question, but I'll take a stab at it:
    Since semantic elements are block-level elements, they would be displayed in the order
    in which they are written into the HTML documents, unless otherwise specified in the
    CSS.

    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
    ** I learned that Sublime allows us to create snippets of code that we'd like
    to pre-populate into our documents, regardless of language. I can essentially create
    a shell of the essential HTML elements for a webpage as a snippet and load
    the snippet without having to type everything in every single time.
    I will absolutely be creating more snippets in the future. They're really helpful
    and allow for efficiency.

    What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
    ** I had a really hard time getting my brain out of the div gutter, but now I'm
    really excited about using semantic elements because they're much easier to read and
    I find that creating an outline of my webpages with them streamlines a lot of the work
    and eliminates a lot of frustration.

    I can practice building websites with semantic elements and using elements that I
    wouldn't normally use.
