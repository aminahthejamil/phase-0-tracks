    <h1>Conundrums</h1>
    <p>Sometimes words make sense. Sometimes they don't. Most of the time I like to
    make sure that my words make sense, but people still don't understand what
    I'm trying to say. It's okay, I understand what I'm trying to say. So I <strong>
    speak in code to the people</strong>.</p>
    <p>On the flip side of things, I don't always understand what people are trying
    to say to me. I doesn't bother me much, <em>but</em> there's sometimes this
    little voice inside my head saying, &quot;Words, for goodness sake! Words!&quot;
    I digress</p>
