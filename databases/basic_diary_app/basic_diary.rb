# Basic Diary for Extraordinary People Pseudocode

# - Will create a database in SQLite to house diary entries
# - Possibly have the users input their name as the name of the diary (table) or whatever name they want
# - Have the users add the date of the entry
# - Add title of the entry (if no title entered (if nil) then write 'Untitled')
# - Add body of text
# - Give them an array of overall moods to choose from for the day

# - Extra abilities for the user:
  # - New entry
  # - Edit old entry (based on [date, title, search for words])
  # - Delete entry
